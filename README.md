# Eve Online Best Deals

upd: after CCP made breaking changes it's broken and abandoned now.

It's my educational project.

There are things to fix and improve but it works.

You want to sync local data (downloaded manually to ./sde), sync orders via ESI, build report about best deals

```
./evedeals -d
./evedeals -o
./evedeals -r
```
